title: "Local Travel"
excerpt: "These are the computer paradigms of Unturned Stones. It’s hard to say that it’s the most important aspect of the world - since everything is interlinked through and though - but if there was one thing one could point to that has somehow impacted everything, it would be these innocent electronic devices."

<p class='text-left'>So, you want to travel, but not that far. It's just out of walking distance, but not far away enough that you need to get a ticket. It's time to go on an adventure!</p>

<p class='text-left'>You might be thinking right now - I'm trying really hard to try to make this interesting. You would be right. But also, that is my job. Now shut up and enjoy a category of vehicles in Unturned Stones.</p>

<p class='text-left'>And lets be up front - all of the passion for automobiles has long vanished. after self-driving became ubiquitous centuries ago.</p>"
