page_description: "<p class='text-justify'>The interstellar economy runs on information. Nothing, not even exotic matter ripped straight from black holes, is as precious as a corporation’s data.</p>

<p class='text-justify'>Metavaski Applied Technologies is just one of numerous similar organizations and corporations that can be found among the stars. Their mission statement: the secure transport and delivery of information to and from research labs and manufactories.</p>

<p class='text-justify'>The Minke, a gargantuan travelling data vault, is their first and only starscraper. Designed to contain valuable blueprints, design specifications, and prototypes for numerous products, it is invulnerable to all but the most brutal and focused of direct assaults due to a battery of low-powered cargo railguns, self-destructing vaults, and Bogatyr security forces.</p>

<p class='text-justify'>The Minke is also quite capable of spreading spoof data and fake, malicious corporate secrets among a solar system’s UNIT networks. Illegal in most places, but for an exorbidant fee, this secondary service is also provided by Metavaski.</p>"
